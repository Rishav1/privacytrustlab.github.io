&lt;p&gt;When building machine learning models using sensitive data, organizations should ensure that the data processed in such systems is adequately protected. For a safe and secure use of machine learning models, it is important to have a quantitative assessment of the privacy risks of these models, and to make sure that they do not reveal sensitive personal information about their training data. Data Protection regulations, such as GDPR, and AI governance frameworks require personal data to be protected when used in AI systems, and that the users have control over their data and awareness about how it is being used. For projects involving machine learning on personal data, it is mandatory from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Article 35 of GDPR&lt;/a&gt; to perform a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). Thus, proper mechanisms need to be in place to quantitatively evaluate and verify the privacy of individuals in every step of the data processing pipeline in AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/privacytrustlab/ml_privacy_meter&quot;&gt;ML Privacy Meter&lt;/a&gt; is a Python library that enables quantifying the privacy risks of machine learning models. The tool provides privacy risk scores which help in identifying data records among the training data that are under high risk of being leaked through the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2020-09-07-MLPrivacyMeter/ml-privacy-meter.png&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models encode information about the datasets on which they are trained. The encoded information is supposed to reflect the general patterns underlying the population data. However, it is commonly observed that these models memorize specific information about some members of their training data [&lt;a href=&quot;#Song17&quot;&gt;Song et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;] or be tricked to do so [&lt;a href=&quot;#Carlini19&quot;&gt;Carlini et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;]. Models with high generalization gap as well as the models with high capacity (such as deep neural networks) are more susceptible to memorizing data points from their training set. This is reflected in the predictions of the model, which exhibits a different behavior on training data versus test data, and in the model's parameters which store statistically correlated information about specific data points in their training set. This vulnerability of machine learning models was shown using &lt;em&gt;membership inference attacks&lt;/em&gt;, where an attacker detects the presence of a particular record in the training dataset of a model, just by observing the model. Machine learning models were shown to be susceptible to these attacks in both the black-box [&lt;a href=&quot;#Shokri17&quot;&gt;Shokri et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;] and white-box settings [&lt;a href=&quot;#Nasr19&quot;&gt;Nasr19 et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;]. The privacy risks of machine learning models can be evaluated as the accuracy of such inference attacks against their training data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the black-box setting such as machine learning as a service offered on cloud platforms by companies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://studio.azureml.net&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/prediction&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, we can only observe predictions of the model. This setting models the scenario can be used to measure the privacy risks against legitimate users of a model who seek predictions on their queries. In the white-box setting, we can also observe the parameters of the model. This reflects the scenario where a model is outsourced to a potentially untrusted server or to the cloud, or is shared with an aggregator in the federated learning setting. &lt;strong&gt;ML Privacy Meter&lt;/strong&gt; implements membership inference attacks in both the black-box and white-box settings. Ability to detect membership in the dataset using the released models is a measure of information leakage about the individuals in the dataset from the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidances released published by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/consultations/2617219/guidance-on-the-ai-auditing-framework-draft-for-consultation.pdf&quot;&gt;Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) for auditing AI&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8269-draft.pdf&quot;&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for securing applications of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; emphasize on the threats to data from models and recommend organizations to account for and estimate these risks to comply with data protection regulations. And they specifically mention membership inference as a confidentiality violation and potential threat to the training data from models. It is recommended in the auditing framework by ICO for organizations to identify these threats and take measures to minimize the risk. As the ICO’s investigation teams will be using this framework to assess the compliance with data protection laws, organizations must account for and estimate the privacy risks to data through models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ML privacy meter can help in DPIA by providing a quantitative assessment of privacy risk of a machine learning model. The tool can generate extensive privacy reports about the aggregate and individual risk for data records in the training set at multiple levels of access to the model. It can estimate the amount of information that can be revealed through the predictions of a model (referred to as Black-box access) and through both the predictions and parameters of a model (referred to as White-box access). Hence, when providing query access to the model or revealing the entire model, the tool can be used to assess the potential threats to training data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2020-09-07-MLPrivacyMeter/privacy_risk.png&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ML Privacy Meter works by implementing membership inference attacks against machine learning models. It simulates attackers with different levels of access and knowledge about the model. It considers attackers who can exploit only the predictions of the model, the loss values, and the parameters of the model. For each of the simulated attacks, the tool reports risk scores for all the data records. These scores represent the attacker’s belief that the record was part of the training dataset. The larger the gap between the distribution of these scores for records that are in the training set versus records that are not in the training set, the larger is the leakage from the model would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2020-09-07-MLPrivacyMeter/roc.png&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success of the attacker can be quantified by an ROC curve representing the trade-off between False Positive Rate and True Positive Rate of the attacker. True positive represents correctly identifying a member as present in the data and False positive refers to identifying a non-member as member. An attack is successful if it can achieve larger values of True Positive rate at small values of False Positive rate. A trivial attack such as random guess can achieve equal True Positive and False Positive Rates. ML Privacy Meter automatically plots the trade-offs that are achieved by our simulated attackers. The area under those curves quantifies the aggregate privacy risk to the data posed by the model. The higher the area under curve, larger the risk. These numbers not only quantify the success of membership inference attacks, but they can also be seen as a measure of information leakage from the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2020-09-07-MLPrivacyMeter/privacy_risk_label45.png&quot; width=&quot;45%&quot;&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When deploying machine learning models, this quantification of risk can be useful while performing a Data Protection Impact Assessment. The aim of doing a DPIA is to analyze, identify and minimize the potential threats to data. ML privacy meter can guide practitioners in all the three steps. The tool produces detailed privacy reports for the training data. It allows comparing the risk across records from different classes in the data. It can also compare the risk posed by providing black box access to the model with the risk due to white box access. As the tool can immediately measure the privacy risks for training data, practitioners can take simple actions such as finetuning their regularization techniques, sub-sampling, re-sampling their data, etc., to reduce the privacy risk. Or they can even choose to learn with a privacy protection, such as differential privacy, in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differential Privacy is a cryptographic notion of privacy, wherein the outputs of a computation should be indistinguishable when any single record in the data is modified. The level of indistinguishability is controlled by a privacy parameter $\epsilon$. Open source tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opendifferentialprivacy/&quot;&gt;OpenDP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy&quot;&gt;TensorFlow Privacy&lt;/a&gt; are available for training models with differential privacy guarantees. Selecting an appropriate value for $\epsilon$ is highly non-trivial when using these tools. Models learned with smaller value of $\epsilon$ provide better privacy guarantees but are also less accurate. $\epsilon$ represents a worst case upper bound on the privacy risk and the practical risk might be much lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ML Privacy Meter can help in the selection of privacy parameters ($\epsilon$) for differential privacy by quantifying the risk posed at each value of epsilon. Compared to just relying on the guarantees provided by epsilon, using this method helps in deploying models with higher accuracy. By letting practitioners choose models with better utility, ML Privacy Meter can enable the use of privacy risk minimization techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leaking information through predictions and parameters, machine learning models pose an additional privacy risk to data in AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To comply with data protection regulations, we need to assess these risks and take possible mitigation measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When releasing statistics about a sensitive dataset, we want to ensure that the privacy of individuals in the dataset is not violated. Releasing even simple statistics (such as averages) about a dataset can reveal information about the specific records in the dataset, for example, the presence of an individual in the dataset [&lt;a href=&quot;#Homer08&quot;&gt;Homer, 2008&lt;/a&gt;]. Given enough such seemingly simple statistics, it is possible to reconstruct the entire dataset with high probability [&lt;a href=&quot;#Dinur03&quot;&gt;Dinur et al., 2003&lt;/a&gt;]. People desire the power to plausibly deny their presence or absence in any given dataset. Hence, the output of a computation should not change by much due to the inclusion of a single individual.  Mathematically rigorous privacy guarantees to individuals are required when releasing computations on sensitive datasets. The level of privacy protection and the success of an attacker trying to obtain information are essentially different narratives of the same story. Therefore, the two important angles to approach this problem are: Developing techniques to automatically protect the privacy of the input data and designing attack algorithms to measure information leakage from the output of a computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracing attacks, also known as membership inference attacks, where an attacker infers if a particular record was present in the training dataset just by observing the outputs of a computation, are considered as a measure of the information leakage about the input dataset from the output. Tracing attacks have been extensively studied for summary statistics, where independent statistics (e.g., mean) of attributes of high-dimensional data are released [&lt;a href=&quot;#Homer08&quot;&gt;Homer, 2008&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Sankararaman09&quot;&gt;Sankararaman et al., 2009&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Dwork15&quot;&gt;Dwork et al., 2015&lt;/a&gt;]. Theoretical frameworks are available to analyze the upper bound on the power of these inference attacks [&lt;a href=&quot;#Sankararaman09&quot;&gt;Sankararaman et al., 2009&lt;/a&gt;], and their robustness to noisy statistics [&lt;a href=&quot;#Dwork15&quot;&gt;Dwork et al., 2015&lt;/a&gt;], but only for simple models such as product distributions. These attacks were also tested against machine learning models on ML as a service platforms offered by Google and Amazon, and also in federated learning settings, showing the privacy vulnerability of such systems [&lt;a href=&quot;#Shokri17&quot;&gt;Shokri et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Nasr19&quot;&gt;Nasr et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Melis19&quot;&gt;Melis et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;]. In its core, learning refers to the estimation of parameters, whether it is the calculation of simple statistics or complex ML models. The difference between these estimated values of a parameter (from the dataset) and true value (estimated from the entire population) is what poses the privacy threat to the dataset. The key to protecting the privacy of an individual record in the dataset is ensuring that its effect on this estimation of parameters is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differential privacy is a widely accepted notion of statistical privacy. This approach requires the output of computation to be more or less unchanged when a single record in the dataset is modified [&lt;a href=&quot;#Dwork06&quot;&gt;Dwork et al., 2006&lt;/a&gt;]. This is generally achieved by randomizing the output of the computation through the addition of noise [&lt;a href=&quot;#Dwork14&quot;&gt;Dwork et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;]. If a trusted curator that can collect all the records exists, the noise can be added at the output of the computation, while providing privacy guarantees to each record. This is generally referred to as global differential privacy. If no such trusted curator exists, each record/contribution needs to be randomized while estimating the final output. This stronger requirement is referred to as local differential privacy. Although it is always desirable to satisfy the stronger notion of local differential privacy, the utility that can be achieved under the notion of global differential privacy is far greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using differential privacy for practical applications, handling the trade-off between the accuracy of the outputs and privacy-risk to individual data is a key challenge. Multiple relaxations of the standard definition of differential privacy were proposed to improve utility and achieve better bounds on privacy loss over the composition of multiple computations [&lt;a href=&quot;#Dwork06a&quot;&gt;Dwork et al., 2006&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Dwork16&quot;&gt;Dwork et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Bun16&quot;&gt;Bun and Steinke, 2016&lt;/a&gt;]. Among these, Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) [&lt;a href=&quot;#Mironov17&quot;&gt;Mironov, 2017&lt;/a&gt;] is widely used because of its ability to provide tight bounds on the composition of tail privacy losses. RDP is based on the notion of Renyi Divergence between the distributions of output computed over two neighboring datasets, as opposed to the notion of Max Divergence used in standard differential privacy. In contrast to the divergence based relaxations of differential privacy, the recently introduced notion of &amp;quot;f-differential privacy&amp;quot; is based on a hypothesis-testing framework [&lt;a href=&quot;#Dong19&quot;&gt;Dong et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;]. Privacy guarantees are defined in terms of the trade-off between Type-I and Type-II errors that are achievable by the most powerful and informed attacker when inferring about the presence of any individual in the dataset. It is worth emphasizing that these are all just desirable definitions of privacy guarantees. A computation needs to be appropriately randomized to satisfy these definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different approach to protecting the privacy of individuals in a sensitive dataset, while also releasing outputs of computations on it, is generating synthetic data from the original dataset and using the synthetic to perform computations [&lt;a href=&quot;#Zhang17&quot;&gt;Zhang et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Bindschaedler17&quot;&gt;Bindschaedler et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;]. The key challenges in generating synthetic data are achieving scalability (across dimensions of the data) and guaranteeing a decent privacy-accuracy trade-off for a given task. Also, the utility of the generated synthetic data heavily depends on the target dataset and the specific task by which utility is measured. Theoretically, there cannot exist a generic synthetic dataset that can accurately answer all queries beyond a certain limit, while also protecting privacy. Hence, the key challenge here is designing techniques that are practical, scalable, and achieve decent utility levels for a given task, at various levels of privacy guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address this problem. It enables multiple participants to learn a highly accurate global model while ensuring that their data remains safe on local devices [&lt;a href=&quot;#Shokri15&quot;&gt;Shokri et al., 2015&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#McMahan17&quot;&gt;McMahan et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;]. In federated learning, each participant downloads a global model from the server and improves the model using their local private dataset. The only information that the participants share with the server is the local (gradient) update. These individual updates are aggregated at the server to improve the global model. Hence, a highly accurate model can be learned from multiple private datasets while also ensuring that the data remains with each participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FL is being celebrated as a success that permits learning while also protecting the local private data but just exchanging model gradients can still pose a significant threat to the local data [&lt;a href=&quot;#Nasr19&quot;&gt;Nasr et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Melis19&quot;&gt;Melis et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Zhu19&quot;&gt;Zhu et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;]. Possible methods to reduce this privacy leakage include sharing fewer gradients, dimensionality reduction of the input space, sharing less sensitive information as local updates [&lt;a href=&quot;#Chang19&quot;&gt;Chang et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;]. Although these methods are easy to implement and only incur a slight reduction of accuracy, there are no provable privacy guarantees or bounds on private information leakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widely-accepted and provable defense is differential privacy (DP), which guarantees that the output distributions are close for adjacent datasets. In the FL system, one can choose to provide participant-level differential privacy [&lt;a href=&quot;#Brendan18&quot;&gt;Brendan et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;], or record-level differential privacy [&lt;a href=&quot;#Abadi16&quot;&gt;Abadi et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;] guarantees. However, these privacy guarantees come at a significant cost to the accuracy of the learned model. In addition to differential privacy, secure multi-party computation can help to guard against information leakage from the updates of a single user [&lt;a href=&quot;#Bonawitz17&quot;&gt;Bonawitz et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;], however, this security comes with a large communication cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an FL system, potentially malicious participants can sabotage the collaborative learning process by manipulating local updates. Existing FL algorithms are not robust to adversarial updates. Even a single party can severely disrupt the global model [&lt;a href=&quot;#Blanchard17&quot;&gt;Blanchard et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Baruch19&quot;&gt;Baruch et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Mhamdi18&quot;&gt;Mhamdi et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;]. Robust aggregation techniques &lt;a href=&quot;#Blanchard17&quot;&gt;Blanchard et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Mhamdi18&quot;&gt;Mhamdi et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Yin18&quot;&gt;Yin et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;] can be used as a defense to mitigate this problem. Yet, the high-dimensional nature of modern deep learning models results in a rapid decline of the theoretical error guarantees provided by these aggregation techniques &lt;a href=&quot;#Blanchard17&quot;&gt;Blanchard et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing FL frameworks share gradients as local updates with the server, which limits all the participants to train on the same model architecture sent by the server. Also, the gradients are usually of high dimension (same as the size as the model), sometimes even having a million dimensions for large deep learning models. It is worthwhile to explore the question of whether it is essential to share the model's gradients to convey information about the local data. More recent work remodels FL by sharing less sensitive model predictions, which allows collaboration between models with heterogeneous architectures [&lt;a href=&quot;#Chang19&quot;&gt;Chang et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;] and also circumvents security and privacy issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, existing FL systems face significant privacy and robustness issues. An open research question is how to build FL systems that provide provable privacy guarantees and are robust to the malicious participants, while also preserving the utility of the learned model.&lt;/p&gt;

AI governance frameworks emphasize on these aspects of AI in the assessment lists for ethical and trustworthy AI. Our research focuses on understanding the trade-offs between different requirements for trust in practical machine learning systems. And especially on quantifying the privacy threats to sensitive data in data processing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-privacy-and-confidentiality&quot;&gt;Data privacy and confidentiality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building machine learning models using sensitive data, organizations should ensure that the data processed is adequately protected. For projects involving machine learning on personal data, it is mandatory from Article 35 of the GDPR to perform a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). The obvious privacy risk lies in is the exposure of sensitive data &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; the computation. Can we trust the party that is running the computation on sensitive data? A more subtle privacy threat is the indirect leakage about data &lt;em&gt;through the output&lt;/em&gt; of computation. Can we trust the party that is observing the output of the computation? The former is generally referred to as protecting confidentiality in computation and the latter as privacy-preserving computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;confidential-computation&quot;&gt;Confidential computation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of confidential computing is to evaluate a function on a private dataset, without exposing the input data beyond what is revealed by the output of the computation. This problem is broadly referred to as secure function evaluation (SFE) and depending on the setting, there are two primary ways to handle it. If a single participant wants to outsource computation on sensitive data, without revealing the data, then Homomorphic Encryption (HE) can be used. Whereas, if there are multiple participants and a function needs to be jointly evaluated, then Secure MultiParty Computation (MPC) can be used to evaluate the function, while also ensuring that no party learns about anyone else's dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is an encryption scheme that allows computation over encrypted data directly, without the explicit requirement to decrypt it before performing the computation. Fully homomorphic encryption can be used to evaluate any arbitrary function of any depth [&lt;a href=&quot;#Gentry09&quot;&gt;Gentry, 2008&lt;/a&gt;]. A Secure MultiParty Computation (MPC) protocol ensures that no participant in the protocol learns more than what they could have learned in the presence of a trusted third-party to perform the computation [&lt;a href=&quot;#Evans18&quot;&gt;Evans et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;]. [&lt;a href=&quot;#Yao86&quot;&gt;Yao, 1986&lt;/a&gt;]'s Garbled Circuit (GC) is one of the first protocols that allowed MPC and forms the foundation of many different MPC protocols today. It allows two parties to securely compute a function that has been converted into a boolean circuit. Although theoretical results about the existence of secure MPC protocols for performing any distributed computational task were provided long ago [&lt;a href=&quot;#Goldreich04&quot;&gt;Goldreich et al., 2004&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Canetti02&quot;&gt;Canetti et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;], it is still a challenging problem to design protocols that have practical communication, memory, and computational costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of machine learning, designing model architectures that are generic enough to perform well over existing datasets, while at the same time reducing the computational cost of SFE is a tricky task. Current work focuses on understanding the trade-off between the accuracy a model architecture can achieve and its computational performance in an SFE setting. This involves designing techniques such as (but not limited to) replacing computationally expensive operations in SFE with their efficient approximations, devising alternative computation strategies that perform the same operations but utilize sub-operations that are more efficient, and reducing data processing precision by quantizing values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-privacy-in-machine-learning&quot;&gt;Data Privacy in Machine Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we perform any computation on a sensitive dataset (e.g. calculating statistics or training machine learning models), it is important to understand the privacy risk of that computation to the individuals in the dataset. Machine learning models pose a subtle privacy risk to the data by indirectly revealing information through the model's predictions and parameters. Guidances released by the Information Commissioner’s Office (UK) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (US) emphasize on the threats to data from models and recommend organizations to account for and estimate these risks to comply with data protection regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we define and quantify this privacy risk from machine learning models to the individuals whose data is used to train the model? To do so, we need to distinguish two types of information that we can learn from the model: 1) Information that is generic to members of the population and 2) Information that is specific to members in the training set. Note that members of the training set are also members of the population. Any information that the model reveals about particular members in the training data beyond what it reveals about an arbitrary member of the population is a privacy threat to the training data. A key focus of research is designing inference attacks to quantify this privacy loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inference attacks on machine learning algorithms fall into two fundamental and related categories: tracing (a.k.a. membership inference) attacks, and reconstruction attacks [&lt;a href=&quot;#Dwork17&quot;&gt;Dwork et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;].  In a  reconstruction attack, the attacker’s objective is to infer attributes of the records in the training set [&lt;a href=&quot;#Dinur03&quot;&gt;Dinur et al., 2003&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Wang09&quot;&gt;Wang et al., 2009&lt;/a&gt;]. In a membership inference attack, however, the attacker’s objective is to infer if a particular individual data record was included in the training dataset [&lt;a href=&quot;#Homer08&quot;&gt;Homer et al., 2008&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Sankararaman09&quot;&gt;Sankararaman et al., 2009&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Dwork15&quot;&gt;Dwork et al., 2015&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Shokri17&quot;&gt;Shokri et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Nasr19&quot;&gt;Nasr19 et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;]. Accuracy of inference attacks can be used as metrics to quantify leakage from machine learning models, and also to measure the effectiveness of privacy protection techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differential Privacy [&lt;a href=&quot;#Dwork06&quot;&gt;Dwork et al., 2006&lt;/a&gt;] is a notion of privacy, wherein the outputs of a computation should be indistinguishable when any single record in the data is modified. If the training process is differentially private [&lt;a href=&quot;#Shokri15&quot;&gt;Shokri et al., 2015&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Abadi16&quot;&gt;Abadi et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;], the probability of producing a given model from a training dataset that includes a particular record is close to the probability of producing the same model when this record is not included. Differentially private models are, by construction, secure against inference attacks. One obstacle is that differentially private models may significantly reduce the model’s prediction depending on how strict of a privacy guarantee is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tool ML Privacy Meter quantifies the privacy risk to data from models through state-of-the-art membership inference attack techniques. By providing practical estimates of the privacy risk posed for different settings, the meter can help in selecting appropriate parameters for the necessary differential privacy guarantee. The tool can also guide practitioners in regulatory compliance by helping them analyze, identify, and minimize the threats to data, when deploying machine learning models [&lt;a href=&quot;#Murakonda20&quot;&gt;Murakonda et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;robustness&quot;&gt;Robustness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we trust a machine learning model to make critical decisions that can affect individuals' socio-economic status? Are the predictions of these models reliable? The predictive behavior of machine learning models can be maliciously modified by slightly perturbing the distribution of training and/or test data. Models that achieve high accuracy on clean data can be made to learn significantly different decision boundaries with the injection of a small amount of poisoned data [&lt;a href=&quot;#Steinhardt17&quot;&gt;Steinhardt et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;]. Test data can be slightly perturbed to create adversarial examples, which look similar to the original data, but can make the model misclassify them. Understanding these threats against the functionality of machine learning models and designing systems that are robust to these attacks is one of the core requirements for building trustworthy AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attackers can corrupt the training data of a machine learning model to achieve different objectives. For example, the attacker might want to degrade the overall test accuracy of the model (called indiscriminate attacks) or increase the loss on specific data points or sub-populations (called targeted attacks). They might even seek to create a backdoor in the learning system to misclassify the backdoor instances as a target label specified by the attacker (called backdoor attacks). Machine learning models were shown to be easily susceptible to these attacks, making their usage in safety-critical systems hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To defend against data poisoning attacks, techniques for achieving training time robustness seek to learn a model that minimizes the out-of-training error even if the training dataset is noisy (or poisoned by an attacker). Data sanitization, also known as outlier detection and anomaly detection, is a very common type of defense against data poisoning attacks [&lt;a href=&quot;#Cretu08&quot;&gt;Cretu et al., 2008&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Chen18&quot;&gt;Chen et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Tran18&quot;&gt;Tran et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;]. Intuitively,  anomaly detectors can filter poisoning data, if the attacker injects points that are very different from the clean data into the training set. However, attackers can generate points that are very similar to the true data distribution but still successfully mislead the model [&lt;a href=&quot;#Koh18&quot;&gt;Koh et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Steinhardt17&quot;&gt;Steinhardt et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;]. A testing-stage defense against backdoor attacks reverses the backdoor trigger from the victim model and then fixes the model through retraining or pruning [&lt;a href=&quot;#Wang19&quot;&gt;Wang et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;]. These defenses do not provide any theoretical guarantees of robustness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adversarial training, a commonly used defense against adversarial examples, aims to ensure that the model produces the same prediction even if the points generated from actual test distribution are slightly modified. The high-level idea is to generate a lot of adversarial examples and explicitly train the model not to be fooled by each of them. Most of the existing adversarial training based defenses do not provide robustness guarantees and demonstrate the robustness property via empirical results. However, adversarial robustness is difficult to measure and many existing defenses have been completely circumvented [&lt;a href=&quot;#Athalye18&quot;&gt;Athalye et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing provably robust algorithms for training in presence of poisoning data and for mitigating adversarial examples are still open problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fairness&quot;&gt;Fairness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 23rd 2016, the nonprofit news platform ProPublica published an article in which it accused an algorithm used to predict the recidivism risks of criminals in many parts of the U.S to be biased against black defendants [&lt;a href=&quot;#Angwin16&quot;&gt;Angwin et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;]. The company behind rebutted the claim an argued that the analysis was faulty. The story nevertheless sparked new interest by the machine learning community into the problem of machine fairness and it is by far not the only example of uncovered bias of (machine learning) algorithms. Some famous examples are the work by &lt;a href=&quot;Buolamwini18&quot;&gt;Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrated wide disparities in prediction accuracy, depending on skin type and gender, of commercial gender classification systems and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G&quot;&gt;news stories&lt;/a&gt; about Amazon stopping the implementation of an AI recruitment tool after it showed bias against women. Problems with (un)fairness of machine learning algorithms can be found in many different application domains and solving them is an active area of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formally, training a machine learning model refers to finding a set of parameters that optimize an average loss function computed over training dataset. However, the parameters that minimize an overall loss might have very different outcomes for different subpopulations and it is often the majority, for which the most and the best data is available, that benefits most from these models. Before one can address unfairness a formal definition of what it means to be fair is needed. In fact many formal definitions with different focus have been proposed.  Some of these metrics focus on equality across sensitive groups [&lt;a href=&quot;#Calders09&quot;&gt;Calders et al., 2009&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Hardt16&quot;&gt;Hardt et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;] others focus on the fairness of individuals and are trying to formalize a notion that similar people should be treated similarly [&lt;a href=&quot;#Dwork12&quot;&gt;Dwork et al., 2012&lt;/a&gt;]. Yet another approach is to establish causality [&lt;a href=&quot;#Kusner17&quot;&gt;Kusner et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;] instead of relying on potentially biased correlations in the data. Many techniques are available to achieve group-based fairness such as pre-processing methods [&lt;a href=&quot;#Madras18&quot;&gt;Madras et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Zemel13&quot;&gt;Zemel et al., 2013&lt;/a&gt;], in-processing methods [&lt;a href=&quot;#Agarwal18&quot;&gt;Agarwal et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Kamishima11&quot;&gt;Kamishima et al., 2011&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Zafar17a&quot;&gt;Zafar et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Zafar17b&quot;&gt;Zafar et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;], and post-processing methods [&lt;a href=&quot;#Hardt16&quot;&gt;Hardt et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards minimizing discrimination against a group, fair machine learning algorithms strive to equalize the behavior of a model across different groups, by imposing a fairness constraint on models. Imposing fairness constraints might come at a cost of the model’s performance and multiple definitions of fairness might not be even compatible with each other [&lt;a href=&quot;#Corbett-Davies17&quot;&gt;Corbett-Davies et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Kleinberg16&quot;&gt;Kleinberg et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;]. It is shown that achieving equal calibration, false positive rate and false negative rate is impossible, if the fraction of positive labeled examples is different across sensitive groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our recent work [&lt;a href=&quot;#Hongyan20&quot;&gt;Hongyan et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;], we show that imposing group-fairness constraints on learning algorithms decreases their robustness to poisoning attacks. An attacker that can only control the sampling and labeling process for a fraction of the training data can significantly degrade the test accuracy of the models learned with fairness constraints. We also show that learning with fairness constraints in presence of such adversarial bias results in a classifier that not only has poor test accuracy but is also potentially more discriminatory on test data. In fact, from a practical perspective, such bias can easily and stealthily be perpetrated in many existing systems, as similar to historical discrimination and/or selection bias. While the goal of fairness is to promote the well-being of the protected groups, surprisingly being fair can cause harm in cases where an unconstrained objective would not when the data changes over time &lt;a href=&quot;#Liu18&quot;&gt;Liu et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, an important research direction in FairML is to study the accuracy, robustness guarantees of fair machine learning algorithms, the potential consequences of using such algorithms in presence of adversarially biased data, and how their behavior changes over time. Another interesting and crucial challenge is to design fair learning algorithms that are also robust to poisoning attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;interpretability&quot;&gt;Interpretability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inherent complexity of machine learning models makes it increasingly difficult to comprehend how and why they make certain classification decisions. Research on interpretable machine learning aims to counteract this development. At least three different significant motivations for interpretable machine learning have been identified [&lt;a href=&quot;#Selbst18&quot;&gt;Selbst et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explanations are necessary to give agency to individuals affected by an automated decision. Decisions based on incorrect data or wrong assumptions can only be corrected if they are understood. Finally, interpretability allows a person to strategically change their behavior and obtain a positive outcome in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An auditor can use explanations to investigate a machine learning model. Explanations might help to improve a model's performance for its initial purpose. They can also be used to discover undesirable side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a moral point, it is inherently unjust to subject a human to black-box decision making. If a fully automatic algorithmic decision cannot be scrutinized, it automatically violates humans personhood, dignity, and autonomy. However, whether or not such a (human) right to explanation exists is still under discussion and has not been broadly legally established [&lt;a href=&quot;#Wachter17&quot;&gt;Wachter et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techniques to achieve interpretable machine learning can be split into two subareas. The first area focuses on creating machine learning algorithms that are inherently interpretable. Those techniques mainly focus on restricting the type or size of used models. The second area focuses on creating explanations or interpretations for already existing methods. The latter can be divided into approaches focusing on a single decision and methods covering the entire model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No clear and widely agreed-upon definition for interpretability exists. The terms explainability, transparency, and interpretability are often interchangeably used. The meaning of interpretability might vary widely from person to person as well among different application areas. Clear definitions will help to develop better-structured evaluation methods and metrics. Conducting comprehensive field tests to see which of the existing methods can obtain the desired results, will help to get from a collection of proposed tools to achieving the goals connected to the above motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploration of interactions between interpretability and other aspects of machine learning like performance, privacy, fairness, and robustness will lead to new insights. While many authors claim that inherently interpretable models come with a significant tradeoff in a model's accuracy, others state that this tradeoff is minimal [&lt;a href=&quot;#Rudin19&quot;&gt;Rudin, 2019&lt;/a&gt;]. There is some evidence that model explanations leak private information about the model's data as well as the model itself [&lt;a href=&quot;#Shokri19&quot;&gt;Shokri, 2019&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;#Milli19&quot;&gt;Milli, 2019&lt;/a&gt;]. Finally, recent work questions the robustness of popular explanation methods [&lt;a href=&quot;#Slack20&quot;&gt;Slack et al., 2029&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
